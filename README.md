# Class-activity
# String-Library
For this project, I will design and implement a custom Python library module to manipulate character strings. The library will include constants and functions that focus on evaluating whether strings consist of specific types of ASCII characters. The goal is to practice working with string operations at a fundamental level without using prebuilt string methods or external libraries. This assignment emphasizes understanding ASCII values and building functions using basic Python features.
